TS-11-difference between OOP and POP

OOP concept : the entry point of your mindset when programming is how to divide / arrange objects

how to use OOP: involving using class

OOP advantages :

1.  plenty of code could be reused eg. new Deck

2.  having much stricter constraints eg. access modifier private

3.  highly composable eg. class Deck highly compose all the functionality of a deck , including create, shuffle, distribute ,

note: TS is not designed to change your way of programming (OOP vs POP) , nor do u have to use its static type system(TS â€™s static type system is optional). So, u can continue to author code in POP mode if u like.
