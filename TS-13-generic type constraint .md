TS-13-generic type constraint

background: writing calling or using a fn , class , interface, or type alias , when pass/specify a concrete generic type , u can pass/specify any type , which is not perfect that sometimes we may need to constrain the type u pass/specify to meet certain customized requirements , so also we need to constrain the generic type T sometimes.

definition: generic type constraint : constraint of generic type : a type used to confine the allowed value of a generic type

note: a generic type is a type that TS donâ€™t know its concrete type until u write calling or write using

note: a generic type constraint is also a type , i think , a supplement to generic type

in conclusion :

generic type constraints are a supplement to generic types
